## Access Flags
Access Flags are used to determine a User's permission level, these are then weighted by level of importance to give an overall User Access Level (integer value), which will determine a hierarchy of Users. Access Flags will be added or removed as necessary to ensure the User has correct permissions to perform each operation in the software.
